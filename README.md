#Solarized Savanna[-esque] SDDM Theme
A simple, elegant theme for SDDM based on the color palette by Ethan Schoonover (http://ethanschoonover.com/solarized) with the objective of being easy to read, especially as the first screen you see before login.

##Resources Used
 - **Champagne & Limousines** The font used, and included, is licensed from Nymphont (http://www.nymfont.com/) with clarification that this is not deemed "web embedding".
 - **System State Buttons** Power, reboot, and stand-by buttons were provided by dAKirby309 (http://dakirby309.deviantart.com/)

##Other Interesting Information
I wasn’t pleased with the login screens available and wanted to finally get my feet wet in creating my first repository. I’ll be creating a Gentoo build package for it soon.

When I was nearly finished creating this theme, I stumbled across another—and what I will call the original—solarized SDDM theme by Maldito Barbudo. Check it out! (https://github.com/MalditoBarbudo/solarized_sddm_theme)
